        <h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
        <h4>Plot</h4>
        <p>
            Long ago, legions of monstrous creatures called Kaiju arose from the sea, bringing with them all-consuming war. To fight
            the Kaiju, mankind developed giant robots called Jaegers, designed to be piloted by two humans locked together
            in a neural bridge. However, even the Jaegers are not enough to defeat the Kaiju, and humanity is on the verge
            of defeat. Mankind's last hope now lies with a washed-up ex-pilot (Charlie Hunnam), an untested trainee (Rinko
            Kikuchi) and an old, obsolete Jaeger.

        <h3>Chappie</h3>
        <h4>Plot</h4>
        <p>
            In the near future, a mechanized police force patrols the streets and deals with lawbreakers -- but now, the people are fighting
            back. When one police droid is stolen and given new programming, he acquires the ability to feel and think for
            himself. While the robot, dubbed "Chappie (Sharlto Copley)," puzzles out human behavior, the authorities begin
            to see him as a danger to mankind and order; they will stop at nothing to ensure that Chappie is the last of
            his kind.
