            <h3>Strix Flare</h4>
                <p>
                    Gamers spend a lot of time carefully picking out components to power their rig, but the most personal part of any build is
                    arguably the keyboard. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how good you are or what kind of hardware
                    you have, if your inputs aren’t registering exactly as intended, you’re toast. Your keyboard is so pivotal
                    to your success, it's easy to get attached, especially since changing things up can be jarring. A new
                    kind of switch or a tweaked layout can be enough to throw you off your game entirely. When you find 'the
                    one,' you tend to stick with what you know works. For the ROG Strix Flare, we wanted to keep all the
                    classic elements of a great keyboard, like a familiar layout, high-quality switches, useful shortcuts,
                    and RGB lighting, but avoid the ‘old faithful’ feeling of familiarity that can sometimes make the tried
                    and true feel just plain tired. The Flare crams in all the non-negotiables but still leaves plenty of
                    room for personalization in form and function. Per-key RGB lighting with more than a dozen lighting effects
                    and multiple ways to program your macros is just the tip of the iceberg. Customizing the removable acrylic
                    insert is where things get really fun, and you don’t even need to be particularly creative to make the
                    Flare totally your own. Keep reading to see what the Flare is like and different methods for modification
                    that range from easy-peasy to mildly hard.

                <h3>Gladius II</h3>
                <p>
                    What pro gamers and enthusiasts want most from a mouse is a good fit. A comfortable position and solid grip enable greater
                    precision and control, which helps players feel more connected and stay focused on the game. For the
                    ROG Gladius II Origin, we worked closely with competitive gamers to build a weapon of war that's reliable
                    and ready to compete at the highest level. Vital feedback from real competitors influenced the ergonomic
                    design to deliver comfort in spades for all grip types. Durable switches sustain endless button-mashing
                    in click-intensive MOBA and MMO games, and they're swappable, so you can tailor the feel to suit your
                    style. Responsive performance and precise 1:1 tracking offers laser-like focus for first-person shooters,
                    giving the mouse broad appeal across different genres. The Origin echoes the head-turning style, extensive
                    programmability, and tweakable RGB lighting of the standard Gladius II with a button layout familiar
                    from the original Gladius. Let's take a closer look.
